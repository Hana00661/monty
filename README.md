## Creating a Monty Bytecode Interpreter

1. Design and Data Structures:

	Stack: Implement a doubly linked list structure to represent the stack efficiently.

	Instructions: Define a structure to hold the opcode and its corresponding function pointer.

	Bytecode File: Define a data structure to represent the bytecode file with lines and tokens.

2. Parsing and Interpretation:

	Parse Bytecode:

		Read the bytecode file line by line using getline.

		Split each line into tokens (opcode and arguments) using strtok.

		Validate the opcode and arguments according to the Monty bytecode syntax.

	Interpret Instructions:

		Implement functions for each supported instruction (e.g., push, pall, pop, etc.).

		Each function should perform the operation specified by the opcode using stack operations.

		Handle invalid instructions and unexpected scenarios with error messages.

3. Memory Management:

	Use malloc and free to dynamically allocate memory for the stack and other data structures.

	Ensure proper memory deallocation to avoid leaks.

	Consider using smart pointers for automatic memory management.

4. Error Handling:

	Implement error handling for various scenarios:

	Invalid instructions or arguments.

	Memory allocation failures.

	Runtime errors like stack overflow/underflow.

	Print informative error messages with line numbers for debugging purposes.

5. Input and Output:

	Implement functions to handle user input and output based on specific instructions.

	Use standard functions like scanf and printf for basic operations.

	Consider implementing file handling for instructions like read and write.

6. Testing and Debugging:

	Write comprehensive unit tests for each instruction and function.

	Utilize debugging tools like GDB to identify and fix errors.

	Test your interpreter with various bytecode files of different complexities.

**Remember, this is a general outline. The specific implementation details will vary depending on the chosen data structures, libraries, and supported instructions. Feel free to ask further questions if you need clarification or assistance with specific aspects of the interpreter development.
